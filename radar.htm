      <h3>Communicator</h3>
      <p>"All great data scientists are master communicators.
After all, data doesn't sell itself; it needs a communicator to guide the way.
You are able to lead key business decision makers into an ongoing conversation with data, rather than carrying out ad hoc analyses.
You have a natural ability to communicate complex technical details to non-technical audiences
You also have an understanding of the wider implications of the project, and so convey the key analysis insights to influence new business directions.
As a communicator you also understand that communication is a two-fold process: explain well, listen well.
You listen for business challenges, define requirements and clarify how data analysis can help.
Even on projects using highly technical software and mathematical methods, you are able to speak a language that each of your stakeholders understands!"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="archtype">
      <h3>Data Wrangler</h3>
      <p>"All great analysis starts with a dataset.
Or rather starts with data in multiple locations, in different formats, languages and timezones.
You understand that defining the question and the approach to creating insight stems from getting the data into a useable format.
You extract, manage and combine data from a variety of sources in a highly efficient manner.
It is a bottom-up approach that fully immerses you in problem solving, as it is in the detail where understanding of a system can be gained.
"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="archtype">
      <h3>Modeller</h3>
      <p>"By creating quantitative descriptions of your data, you create insight that is a key deliverable for your team.
You interpret the meaningful reasons for features in a dataset.
You also pay attention to the detail of underlying assumptions, limits and exceptions when describing a system.
You are familiar with a variety of mathematical methods for describing dynamic systems and are highly skilled in using software that implements these.
You use a variety of graphical and numeric techniques to verify that you are delivering a high quality result that can be used to predict and optimise future performance.
When you are on the team, if there is information that can be gleaned from a system, you will find it.
"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="archtype">
      <h3>Programmer</h3>
      <p>"When you are at the forefront of innovation, often the tools needed to solve a problem simply do not exist.
You may already be a master of multiple technical languages and enjoy adding languages to your skillset.
You combine carefully constructed analysis workflow, with robust pipelines to automate as much of the process as possible, but enjoy building applications from scratch.
You understand the value of planning, and know that thinking through an analysis is more efficient and less error prone than starting an analysis and seeing what sticks.
You always ensure that your customers are not misled by your work by providing thorough reporting, including lists of assumptions and descriptions of algorithms along with your findings.
You use software development approaches such as unit testing and version control to ensure that costly mistakes are not caused by your work.
Your cool head and rational approach serve as a great counterpoint to team members whose focus on the big picture can lead to key details being missed."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="archtype">
      <h3>Technologist</h3>
      <p>"Never satisfied with good enough, you find the best tool to aid with every challenge.
Since every challenge is different, it is often faster and more efficient to use technologies that have been created elsewhere, rather than reinventing the wheel.
You are continually interested in exploring how evolving tools and techniques can add value to the data science workflow.
Modern multi-purpose programming languages provide the perfect environment to stand on the shoulders of giants and truly see further than others.
You know how to use many different technologies, which allows you to educate your team on possible ways to interrogate a dataset.
It is the value this approach provides to the team that really allows you to focus on using novel approaches to problem solving that would be impossible building tools from the ground up."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="archtype">
      <h3>Visualiser</h3>
      <p>"As a visualiser, you convert information into a landscape that can be explored with the eyes to create an information map.
This skillset is absolutely indispensable for organisations that are lost in information!
That said, you don't like to be kept on a short leash.
You welcome the chance to experiment and explore all possible data opportunities and the new product avenues it can open.
Avenues visualised, you have a creative urge to go beneath the surface to uncover creative data solutions that can permeate the entire business.
Solutions identified, you are creative in conveying information visually, using a variety of graphical tools, to ensure the patterns you find are presented coherently; both to internal and external customers.
Seeing is believing, so you may be the most important storyteller on the team."</p>
